Concrete Ace Eco-friendly advanced concrete using plastic waste and quality assessment through Artificial intelligence (AI) detection.

<p>
Eco-friendly advanced concrete is an innovative construction material that integrates plastic waste, such as recycled bottles or packaging, into the concrete mix. By replacing a portion of traditional aggregates with plastic waste, this concrete reduces landfill waste and lowers the carbon footprint of production. The inclusion of plastic enhances the material's properties, offering potential improvements in strength, durability, and thermal insulation. Quality assessment of this sustainable concrete is conducted through AI detection technologies, which analyze and predict the performance and consistency of the material. This AI-driven approach ensures that the concrete meets industry standards while promoting environmentalÂ sustainability.
